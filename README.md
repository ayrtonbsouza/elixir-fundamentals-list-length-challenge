# ListLength

This is a application developed as a challenge for Elixir Ignite Bootcamp, proposed by RocketSeat.

## About the challenge

In this challenge, I must create a function that, given a list of numbers (for example: `[1, 3, 6, 43, 6]`), calculates, **recursively**, how many elements are in the list and return that value.

For example, we have the following input and output expected by the function that receives the list:

`` bash
iex> ListLength.call ([1, 2, 3, 5, 7])
...> 5
``

To do this, you can start a project using the command:

`` bash
mix new list_length
``

Where `list_length` is the name given to the project.

If you want to test your implementation from the terminal, run `iex -S mix` inside the project's root directory ðŸš€
